# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Git Worktree Manager is a modern PyQt6-based GUI application that simplifies Git worktree operations across multiple Git projects, enabling developers to efficiently work with multiple branches and repositories simultaneously. The tool provides smart branch management capabilities, clear visual feedback, and comprehensive safety features to streamline the worktree workflow for multiple projects from a single interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage multiple Git projects in a single interface, so that I can work with worktrees across different repositories efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a project list showing all managed Git repositories
2. WHEN I add a new project THEN the system SHALL validate it's a Git repository and add it to the project list
3. WHEN I select a project THEN the system SHALL display all worktrees for that specific project
4. WHEN I remove a project THEN the system SHALL remove it from the list without affecting the actual repository
5. WHEN no projects are configured THEN the system SHALL display a welcome screen with options to add projects

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view all existing worktrees for each project in a clear interface, so that I can quickly understand my current worktree setup across projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is selected THEN the system SHALL display a list of all existing worktrees for that project
2. WHEN displaying worktrees THEN the system SHALL show the worktree path, associated branch, status, and project name
3. WHEN a worktree is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight it and show additional details
4. WHEN no worktrees exist for a project THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL update the worktree list immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new worktrees with automatic branch management, so that I can quickly set up new development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request to create a new worktree THEN the system SHALL prompt for worktree path and branch information
2. WHEN creating a worktree for a new branch THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch the latest remote changes
3. WHEN creating a worktree for an existing branch THEN the system SHALL validate the branch exists
4. WHEN the worktree creation is successful THEN the system SHALL update the worktree list and show success feedback
5. IF the specified path already exists THEN the system SHALL display an error and prevent creation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove worktrees safely, so that I can clean up my workspace without losing important work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a worktree for removal THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog with worktree details
2. WHEN confirming worktree removal THEN the system SHALL check for uncommitted changes
3. IF uncommitted changes exist THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require explicit confirmation
4. WHEN removal is successful THEN the system SHALL update the worktree list and show success feedback
5. IF removal fails THEN the system SHALL display the specific error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear visual feedback for all operations, so that I understand what's happening and can identify issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation is running THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL display success messages with relevant details
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL display error messages with actionable information
4. WHEN displaying command output THEN the system SHALL format it in a readable, syntax-highlighted manner
5. WHEN the application state changes THEN the system SHALL update the interface immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to open worktrees in my preferred applications, so that I can quickly start working in the correct environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a worktree THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with available actions
2. WHEN I select "Open in File Manager" THEN the system SHALL open the worktree path in the system file manager
3. WHEN I select "Open in Terminal" THEN the system SHALL open a terminal session in the worktree directory
4. WHEN I select "Open in Editor" THEN the system SHALL open the worktree in the configured code editor
5. IF an action fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to validate operations before execution, so that I can avoid common mistakes and data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt any worktree operation THEN the system SHALL validate the current Git repository state
2. WHEN creating a worktree THEN the system SHALL validate the target path is writable and available
3. WHEN removing a worktree THEN the system SHALL validate the worktree exists and is not the current working directory
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent the operation
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with the operation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent project management, so that my configured projects are remembered between application sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a project THEN the system SHALL save the project configuration to persistent storage
2. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL load all previously configured projects
3. WHEN I remove a project THEN the system SHALL remove it from persistent storage
4. WHEN project paths become invalid THEN the system SHALL mark them as unavailable but retain the configuration
5. WHEN an unavailable project becomes accessible again THEN the system SHALL automatically restore its functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute commands within specific worktrees, so that I can run development tasks directly from the interface without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a worktree THEN the system SHALL provide an option to "Run Command" in the context menu
2. WHEN I select "Run Command" THEN the system SHALL display a command input dialog with the worktree path context
3. WHEN I execute a command THEN the system SHALL run it in the selected worktree directory
4. WHEN a command is running THEN the system SHALL capture both standard output and standard error streams
5. WHEN a command is running THEN the system SHALL display the output in real-time in a dedicated output panel
6. WHEN a command is executing THEN the system SHALL remain responsive and allow other operations
7. WHEN a command completes THEN the system SHALL show the final exit code and execution time
8. WHEN displaying command output THEN the system SHALL format it with syntax highlighting and proper formatting

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern, responsive interface, so that the tool is pleasant and efficient to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern PyQt6 interface with project and worktree panels
2. WHEN resizing the window THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout proportions
3. WHEN performing operations THEN the system SHALL remain responsive and not freeze
4. WHEN displaying lists THEN the system SHALL support sorting and filtering capabilities for both projects and worktrees
5. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL respond to common shortcuts for efficiency
